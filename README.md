# Rodrik
Rodrik is a digital comic book library management system in its very early stages.

The general goals are high performance, a central database for quick queries, interoperability with existing systems, scriptability, and possibly injecting metadata into existing .cbr/.cbz files.

IDK, let's see how it goes.

# Inspiration

- [Beets](https://github.com/beetbox/beets) is a major inspiration, as it offers very powerful command-line management of a music library.
- Named after [Rodrik "the Reader" Harlaw](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Rodrik_Harlaw).
